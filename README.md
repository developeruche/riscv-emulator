# RISV-V Emulator
This is a simple attempt to create a RISC-V emulator in Rust with the goal of understanding the RISC-V architecture and it application in zkVM. 
The emulator is based on the RV32I base integer instruction set. The emulator is capable of running simple programs written in RISC-V assembly language.
